## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data Input** – Users enter their medical data:
   - Number of Pregnancies
   - Glucose Level
   - Blood Pressure
   - Skin Thickness
   - Insulin Level
   - BMI (Body Mass Index)
   - Diabetes Pedigree Function
   - Age
2. **Prediction** – The trained model processes the input and predicts whether the person is diabetic.
3. **Result** – Displays a clear, readable result:  
   ✅ *"The person is not diabetic"* or ❌ *"The person is diabetic"*.
